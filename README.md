# Project Prioritization App
Project Prioritization is a web application for prioritizing projects that are on queue based on the scores rated with respect to the criteria.

Steps to run the app:

1. Open project in Visual Studio.
2. Open web.config in the root folder.
3. Inspect the connection strings and change the user id and password to the corresponding local MySQL credentials.
4. Import ppa.sql to local MySQL database.
5. Explore :D

Note: BRD means Business Requirements Document. I used that flag to determine whether the queued project already has design documents.
